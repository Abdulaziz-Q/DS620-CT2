Critical Thinking Assignment 2 is part of DS620 (Data Visualization) course

### CT2: Showing the Factors for the Churn

In this critical thinking, our mission is to create an MS Power BI dashboard file that visualizes the companyâ€™s look-a-like user and factors that affect the user churn for the company. The dataset that will be used is the Telecom users dataset from Kaggle in the following link (https://www.kaggle.com/radmirzosimov/telecom-users-dataset). First mission is to import the dataset and convert in the Power BI if required. The second mission we will be creating a visualization that shows the look of the company (a typical user for the company). The last mission is to display the effects on a company's user churn.
